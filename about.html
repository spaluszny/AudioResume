                <h1>Hi! I'm Sarah Paluszny.</h1>
                <p>My name is Sarah Paluszny, and I'm an aspiring audio engineer with a focus on film sound design.
                    I attended the Jacobs School of Music and earned dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Audio
                    Engineering
                    and Sound Production as well as Informatics.</p>
                <p>During my time at the school, I had the opportunity to dedicate over 400 hours to sound production
                    for various performances and events. This experience helped me hone my skills in live sound and
                    understand the intricacies of sound production.</p>
                <p>In addition to my expertise in sound production, I'm also proficient in programming languages such as
                    Python, SQL, and web design tools such as HTML/CSS. This knowledge allows me to approach sound
                    design
                    from a holistic perspective, understanding the technical aspects of audio engineering and how it
                    integrates with other elements of film production. </p>

                <p>My ultimate career goal is to become a sound designer for movies. I'm passionate about using my
                    technical
                    skills and creative vision to bring cinematic soundscapes to life. With my education, dedication,
                    and experience,
                    I'm confident that I'll be able to make a significant impact in the world of audio engineering and
                    film production.</p>
